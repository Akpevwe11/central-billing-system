### Objective
The objective of this document is to define the platform for interaction between the Nasarawa State Central Billing System (CBS) web service platform and third-party platforms for the purpose of carrying out specific processes. 
The communication mode is via REST web service and is accessible via the URL (to be provided).

### Intended Audience
This document is intended to serve as specifications for the technical team of an integrating party to design and develop 
components to interface with CBS.


### Security
The `client ID` and `client secret` MUST be included in every web service request to ensure only authorized platforms get access to interact with the CBS platform via web service. 
These parameters must be set in the authorization header of every request to ensure restricted access.
The `HMAC` `SHA` `256` `HEX` Digest is also employed during request such that the integrating system will re-compute the digest to confirm the correctness of the decrypted data.
